App
+/- List of movies is clean but does take up a lot of screen real state
+ application is fast and responsive
+ Page layout is simple and clean using basic bootstrap
+ couldn't manage to crash the page
- page reloads resets local storage state
- add a movie form does not clear itself after inputting a movie
- Total runtime watched won't show total time if one movie does not have a watch time
- Total runtime is showing for all time, not the last month as specified in the requirements
- no real way to choose what movie you want, you just gotta submit and hope it is the correct one

Code
+ Competent level of react and JS knowledge is displayed
+ JSX is structured cleanly and component names make sense
- No real code structure, everything is in the same folder
- page has sorting but it is done oddly with it mutating the local storage state and relying on the frontend to pull in the new state
- a lot of leftover console logs
- Some function names are confusing, for example the function to add movies to the list is called getData
